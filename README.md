This Todo app backend is built using Express.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. It provides several functionalities to manage todos efficiently:

1) Create Todo: You can add a new todo item with a title, description, and optionally a due date or any other relevant information. This allows users to keep track of tasks they need to complete.
2) Update Todo by ID: You can modify an existing todo item by specifying its unique ID. This functionality enables users to edit task details such as updating the title, description, or due date.
3) Get All Todos: This feature retrieves a list of all todos that have been created. It provides a comprehensive view of all tasks currently in the system, making it easy for users to see their entire task list at once.
4) Delete Todo by ID: Users can delete a specific todo item by its ID. This action removes the task from the system, helping users manage their task list by removing completed or unnecessary todos.
